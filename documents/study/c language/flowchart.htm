A flowchart is graphical representation of an algorithm. These flowcharts play a vital role in the programming of a problem and are quite helpful in understanding the logic of complicated and lengthy problems. Once the flowchart is drawn, it becomes easy to write the program in any high level language. Often we see how flowcharts are helpful in  explaining the program to others. Hence, it is correct to say that a flowchart is a must for the better documentation of a complex program.<br><br>
<b>Flowcharts are usually drawn using some standard symbols; however,</b><br><br>
