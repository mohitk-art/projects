<b><u>Types of Computer Languages </u></b><br/>
while easily understood by computers, machine languages are almost impossible for humans to use because they consist entirely of numbers. Programmers, therefore, use either a high-level programming language or an assembly language. There are three types of languages. <br/>
1. <b>Machine Language</b><br/>
2. <b>Assembly Language</b><br/>
3. <b>high Level Language</b><br/>

<li><u><b>Machine Languages</b></u></li>
Sometimes referred to as machine code or object code, machine languages is a collection of binary digits or bits that the computer reads and interprets. It is written in hex. <br>
<ul type="square">
<li>Normally written as strings of binary 1s and 0s, the symbol 0 stands for the absence of an electric pulse and the 1 stands for the presence of an electric pulse. Since a computer is capable of recognizing electric signals, it understands machine language.</li>
<li>The set of symbol instruction codes usually in binary form that is used to represent operations and data in a machine (as a computer) --called also machine code.</li></ul><br>
<li><u><b>Assembly Language</b></u></li>
This is another low-level but very important language in which operation codes and operands are given in the form of alphanumeric symbols instead of 0's and 1's.<br/>
These alphanumeric symbols are known as mnemonic codes and can combine in a maximum of five letter combination e.g. ADD for addition, SUB for subtraction, START, LABEL etc. Because of this feature, assembly language is also known as 'Symbolic Programming Language.'<br>
<ul>
<li>Assembly language is just one level higher than machine language.</li>
<li>Assembly language consists of simple codes.</li>
<li>Each statement in an assembly language corresponds directly to a machine code understood by the cpu.</li>
<li>The software used to convert an assembly program into machines codes is called an assembler.</li>
</ul>
<li><u><b>High Level Language</b></u></li>
It is machine independent programming language. It does not require programmers to know anything about the internal structure of computer on which high level language programs will be executed. It only deals with high level coding and enables the programmers to write instructions using English words and familiar mathematical symbols and expressions</ol>
