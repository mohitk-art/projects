 <h1>I. Data Models in DBMS</h1>

A database model is a type of data model that determines the logical structure of a database and fundamentally determines in which manner data can be stored, organized and manipulated. 
<b>Common logical data models for databases include:</b>
<br>

<ol>

<h2><li>Physical Data Model</li></h2>

Physical data model represents how the model will be built in the database. 
A physical database model shows all table structures, including column name,
 column data type, column constraints, primary key, foreign key, and relationships between tables

<b>The steps for physical data model design are as follows:</b>
<ol>

<li>Convert entities into tables.</li>

<li>Convert relationships into foreign keys.</li>

<li>Convert attributes into columns.</li>

<li>Modify the physical data model based on physical constraints / requirements.</li>

</ol>

<h2><li>Hierarchical database model</h2>
</li>

A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data is organized into a tree-like structure. The data is stored as records which are connected to one another through links. A record is a collection of fields, with each field

<h2><li>Network model</h2></li>

The network model is a database model conceived as a flexible way of representing objects and their relationships. Its distinguishing feature is that the schema, viewed as a graph in which object types are nodes and relationship types are arcs, is not restricted to being a hierarchy or lattice.

<h2><li>Relational model</h2></li>

A database organized in terms of the relational model is a relational database. where all data is represented in terms of tuples, grouped into relations.

The relational model (RM) for database management is an approach to managing data using a structure and language

<h2><li>Entity–relationship model</h2></li>

An ER model is composed of entity types (which classify the things of interest) and specifies relationships that can exist between instances of those entity types.
<br><br>

In software engineering an ER model is commonly formed to represent things that a business needs to remember in order to perform business processes. Consequently, the ER model becomes an abstract data model that defines a data or information structure that can be implemented in a database, typically a relational database.

<h2><li>Enhanced entity–relationship model</h2></li>

<h2><li>Object model</h2></li>

An object database (also object-oriented database management system, OODBMS) is a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming. Object databases are different from relational databases which are table-oriented[citation needed]. Object-relational databases are a hybrid of both approaches.
